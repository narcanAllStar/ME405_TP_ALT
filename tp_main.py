@file main.py
    This file contains a demonstration program that runs some tasks, an
    inter-task shared variable, and a queue. The tasks don't really @b do
    anything; the example just shows how these elements are created and run.
    This file contains the code to succesfully run 2 motors with motor control
    according to lab3 of ME-405.
        * the motors run a step response and dump that data to the terminal in
            which it can be copied to a csv (this can be replaced by a uart or other connection
            but is simple this way)
        * only the data from the step response is printed to the terminal once
            the rest of the data from the run is not printed to the terminal

TODO:
    * Test prevous functionality on boards
    * Implement motor control for one motor
        * cotask.py should have timing at around 10ms
        * make sure run() method in controllor class only does one calc each time
        * Run the motor with a flywheel
            * print results and plot step response like before
            * find the slowest rate at which the controllers preformance is noticably worse
            * Record the slowest rate at which the performance is not significantly worse than when running the controller at a fast rate
            * choose a good run rate for the motor control task - it should be a bit faster than the slowest rate which works for a factor of safety
            * Save copies of the step response plots for the slowest rate at which the response is good and for a rate at which the response isn't as good.
    * make two tasks which run two motors under closed-loop control at the same time
        * write a test program which moves your motors simultaneously through different distances and holds them at the desired positions
